## Installation

Fork, and clone the repo.


to install the latest version of python on mac run:
```
brew install python3
```
note: this will pull the latest version of python, so when python 3.8 or greater is released it will install that version,



to install python3.7 on ubuntu 18.04 just run the command:
```
sudo apt-get install python3.7 -y 
```

to install python3.7 on ubuntu 16.04 follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/CodeForPortland/recordexpungPDX/wiki/Installing-python3.7-on-ubuntu-16.04)



### Install Pipenv

- Install the [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install) package manager which also automatically creates and manages virtual environments.

A [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) controls installing dependencies, running the Flask app, and removing build artifacts:

- Install dependencies:

Running:

```
$ make install
```

will read `Pipfile` and install listed Python packages into a `Pipenv` virtualenv.

- Run Flask app (also installs dependencies):

Running:

```
$ make run
```

will run the `Flask` app inside a `Pipenv` virtualenv.

- Clean:

Running:

```
$ make clean
```

will remove build artifacts.

### Testing

Currently using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing.   
Run all tests with the following command:

```bash
$ make test
```

 1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository)** the repo on GitHub
 2. **[Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork)** the project to your own machine. Replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your github username.
   ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/recordexpungPDX.git
   ```
 3. cd into recordexpungPDX
   ```bash
    $ cd recordexpungPDX
   ```
 4. Configure upstream to sync with your fork
   ```bash
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodeForPortland/recordexpungPDX.git
   ```
 5. Create a branch to work on. Replacing BRANCH_NAME with a descriptive name of the work planned such as `update_contributing_doc`
   ```bash
     $ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
   ```
 6. **Commit** changes to your branch (never to master)
 7. **Push** your work back up to your fork
   ```bash
     $ git push
   ```
   - NOTE: The first time you do `git push` on your branch it will error with:
   ```bash
    fatal: The current branch BRANCH_NAME has no upstream branch.
    To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

        git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME
   ```
   - Copy the output and run it. Then afterwords simply push more commits by running `git push`.
 8. Submit a **Pull request**

- NOTE: For future contributions be sure to sync master with upstream
```bash
  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull upstream master
  $ git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```
